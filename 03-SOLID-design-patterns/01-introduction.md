## SOLID

**S** - Single Responsibility Principle: Each class or module should have a single responsibility.


**O** - Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
**L** - Liskov Substitution Principle: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting functionality.
**I** - Interface Segregation Principle: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface.
**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.
